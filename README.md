Built an interactive NLP dashboard to analyze 1M+ Sephora product reviews, uncover ingredient risks, and empower consumers with transparent insights on skincare safety, sentiment, and trends.
  </p>

### Description:
This end-to-end data science project transforms unstructured beauty product reviews and ingredient metadata into a powerful consumer-facing intelligence platform. Using NLP, sentiment analysis, and real-time visualizations, the dashboard delivers:

#### Sentiment Analysis: Classifies reviews into positive, neutral, and negative using VADER and visualizes buzzwords by tone.
#### Rating Trends: Reveals long-term rating shifts, brand performance, and top-reviewed products over time.
#### Ingredient Risk Checker: Cross-references over 2,000 products with international regulatory databases (FDA, EWG, EU) to flag:
- Carcinogens
- Allergens
- Endocrine Disruptors
#### Word Cloud: Instantly highlights trending concerns and qualities (e.g., “dry,” “hydrating,” “greasy”) in customer sentiment.
#### Global Filters: Allow users to drill down by brand, product, concern, date range, and skin type.

The dashboard is built using Streamlit, with custom visualizations via Plotly, NLP via NLTK/VADER, and enhanced filtering through metadata preprocessing.

📅 Timeline: February–April 2025

📦 Tools Used: Python, Streamlit, Plotly, NLTK (VADER), Pandas, Scikit-learn, WordCloud, Regex, FDA/EWG/COSING datasets
